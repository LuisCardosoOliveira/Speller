# Speller

Speller is a program to spell-checks words in english from a text.

The Program is based on C and takes as input a text, then compare it with the words present in a dictionary, and then output the number of misspelled words.

I have used a Hash Table to organise the words presents in a dictionary in linked lists.

I've also created a hash function that index the words in the hash table in a very fast and efficient way.
